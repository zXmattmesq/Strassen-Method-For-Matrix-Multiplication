Class MatrixOperations:

This is a simple Python class that handles various matrix operations. It includes functions to get the dimensions of two matrices, create an empty matrix of a given size, and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, and standard multiplication. The class also splits a matrix into four quadrants and then recombines them, which is used by the Strassen algorithm for faster matrix multiplication on large matrices. Using a recursive divide-and-conquer approach for multiplying matrices.
